                    The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of currently 6 items that they rotate seasonally.

                    Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Marco and Roberto, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.

                    <p>
                    To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.

                    <p>
                    Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the mediterranean region.
